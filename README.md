# Portfolio

This project is my portfolio ! It allows me to show all the projects I have worked on. It also allows me to experiment, test and discover.

## Articles

All cards is a markdown file which is stored in the `content` folder. This folder is subdivided in categories.

To create a new article, a template can be used !

## Build

```sh
# Start the dev server
yarn dev
# Build the static site
yarn generate
```

This _Nuxt Project_ is a static site and automatically deploy on Netlify.
